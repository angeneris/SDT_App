## **Coin Toss Simulator**

This is a simple application built using Streamlit that simulates random coin flips. It allows users to specify the number of trials and observe the resulting outcomes in real-time through a line chart.

**Description:** The Coin Toss Simulator is a Python application designed to simulate random coin flips. It utilizes the scipy.stats module for statistical functions and Streamlit for the web interface. The user interface allows users to specify the number of trials for the simulation. Upon clicking the 'Run' button, the application conducts the specified number of trials and displays the outcome of each trial in real-time using a line chart.

The application is designed to provide a simple and interactive way to visualize the results of multiple coin flips and observe how the frequency of heads (or tails) evolves over the course of the simulation. It serves as a demonstration of using Streamlit for building interactive data science applications.


### **How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. <br> 
2. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.  <br> 
3. Run the application using Streamlit by executing streamlit run coin_toss_simulator.py in your terminal. <br> 
4. Adjust the slider to specify the number of trials. <br> 
5. Click the 'Run' button to start the simulation and observe the results. <br>
